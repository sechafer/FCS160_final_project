            <h3>üéØ Identified Value Conflict</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Area:</strong> Physical self-care (diet, exercise, sleep)<br>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> 8/10<br>
                <strong>Action consistency:</strong> 7/10<br>
                <strong>Specific focus:</strong> Improve diet and overall health together with my wife, aiming for weight loss through healthier eating habits
            </div>

            <h3>üîç Why this conflict occurred?</h3>
            <p>This conflict occurred primarily due to financial pressures and prioritization of other immediate expenses such as rent, education, and basic household needs. Consequently, my wife and I have tended to overlook healthier eating choices, opting instead for cheaper, more convenient options that often aren't nutritious.</p>

            <h3>üìä Areas of imbalance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Too little time/effort:</strong> Meal planning, cooking nutritious meals at home, regular physical activity</li>
                <li><strong>Too much time/effort:</strong> Work, managing financial responsibilities, educational activities</li>

                    "For the next three weeks, my wife and I will plan meals each Sunday evening, maintain a weekly grocery budget of R$200 for nutritious foods, and record all our daily meals in a journal to ensure we consistently eat healthily and support our weight-loss goals."

                <h4>3. External Support Involvement</h4>

            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>5. Richer Documentation</h4>
